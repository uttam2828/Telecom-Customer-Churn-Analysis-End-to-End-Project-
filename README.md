## 🧠 My Approach (Business + Technical)

Instead of directly jumping into modeling, I approached this problem like a business analyst:

1. Explored the dataset to understand customer behavior
2. Used SQL to answer business questions
3. Validated insights using Python EDA
4. Built a machine learning model to predict churn
5. Created a Power BI dashboard for stakeholders

📌 This ensures a balance between **business understanding and technical execution**

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python + SQL)

* Handled missing values
* Converted data types (e.g., TotalCharges → numeric)
* Removed duplicates and inconsistencies

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
* Correlation analysis
* Identified key churn patterns

---

### 3️⃣ SQL Analysis

* Churn rate calculation
* Customer segmentation
* Revenue loss estimation
* Service-level churn analysis

---

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Model

* Logistic Regression

**Evaluation Metrics:**

* Accuracy: **80–85%**
* Precision: **~78%**
* Recall: **~72%**
* ROC-AUC Score: **~0.84**

📌 Interpretation:
The model effectively identifies high-risk customers and can support targeted retention strategies.

## 🔍 Key Factors Influencing Churn

Top features impacting churn:

* Contract Type
* Monthly Charges
* Tenure
* Online Security
* Payment Method

📌 Insight:
Customer commitment and service engagement are the strongest predictors of churn.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* 🔴 **Overall Churn Rate:** ~26.5% → major retention issue

* 🔴 **Contract Type Impact:**

  * Month-to-Month: **42% churn**
  * 1-Year: **11% churn**
  * 2-Year: **3% churn**
    → Customers without commitment are **4x more likely to churn**

* 🔴 **Monthly Charges Effect:**

  * Churned: **₹2,800 avg**
  * Retained: **₹2,100 avg**
    → High-paying customers have **~30% higher churn risk**

* 🔴 **Tenure Impact:**

  * < 12 months: **50% churn**
  * > 24 months: **<15% churn**
    > → Early-stage customers are highest risk

* 🔴 **Add-on Services:**

  * Without security: **35% churn**
  * With security: **15% churn**

* 🔴 **Payment Method:**

  * Electronic Check: **45% churn**
  * Auto Payment: **15–18% churn**

* 🔴 **Internet Type:**

  * Fiber Optic: **41% churn**
  * DSL: **19% churn**
